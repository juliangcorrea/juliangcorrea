Hi, I'm Julian Correa! 👋

💻 I’m a self-taught programmer and lawyer who ventured into the world of web development. I’ve been into coding since I was a teenager, and I’ve finally committed to pursuing it more seriously. While I really enjoy programming, I’m also interested in working with tech solutions down the line, which is why I would like to explore engineering in the future.

🧰 I learned the basics from The Odin Project course, which provided me with a solid foundation in web development.I learned essential skills and gained hands-on experience that helped me land my first small job creating websites. Now I'm focused on sharpening my skills as I work to advance my career and pursue new job opportunities in the field.
